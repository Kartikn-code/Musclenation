>model (we create a class object) for exmaple
Customer class: Object [customer] ->  python manage.py makemigrtions ->
0001.stash()-> object encrypted (and also contains mapping)-> settings file -> database:
	python manage.py migrate (create a table / schema in the corresponding db)

admin.site.register- it gives feasibility to do certain operations without implementation of business logic (view)
	and template( UI rendering) load model directly in it

model -< interacts with database ( which it has database logic)
view -< it carries business logic takes input as request and proces from the request by interacting between
the model and view 
process req to model and model interacts with db fetchs information passed as processed data to view and share this as
a response to the template
